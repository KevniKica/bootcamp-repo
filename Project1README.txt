Why I wrote this project?

This is my Weekly Weather Report project. I built this project because I believe knowing the weather affects the plans you make immensely. It solves the problems of hoping you have good weather and plans being ruined due to weather. If you know in advance, you can plan for it!

What did I learn?

I learned how use and implement multiple API's to work together. I learned how to better use CSS frameworks that were not Bootstrap. And lastly, I learned how to be much more efficient coding, and somewhat make my code cleaner and less cluttered.

What makes my project stand out?

I was able to integrate the weekly weather for day and night, have a theme swap as a button and the website allows you to search places however you would want to in ways such as address, zip code, town, and even landmark name!
